## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Synapse Language seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create a Public Issue

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, report them privately.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to: **security@synapse-lang.com** (to be set up)

Or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
- Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/MichaelCrowe11/synapse-lang/security)
- Click "Report a vulnerability"

### 3. Include the Following Information

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source files related to the vulnerability
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the vulnerability (what an attacker could achieve)

### 4. Response Timeline

We will respond to security reports within:
- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fix
- **30 days**: Security patch released (for high/critical issues)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: We use Bandit and CodeQL for security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability monitoring
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused code review
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP secure coding guidelines

### Dependency Management

- **Minimum Versions**: We specify minimum secure versions for all dependencies
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are updated monthly for security patches
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Automated alerts for known vulnerabilities
- **Optional Dependencies**: Security-sensitive features are optional

### Execution Security

- **Sandboxing**: Built-in execution sandboxing for untrusted code
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits to prevent DoS attacks  
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs
- **Safe Defaults**: Secure-by-default configuration

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

Synapse Language includes several security features:

1. **Execution Sandboxing**
   ```synapse
   # Automatically sandboxed execution
   execute_safe("untrusted_code.syn")
   ```

2. **Resource Limits**
   ```synapse
   # Built-in resource constraints
   with resource_limits(memory="1GB", time="30s"):
       run_simulation()
   ```

3. **Input Validation**
   ```synapse
   # Automatic input sanitization
   uncertain user_input = validate_numeric(input) ¬± error_bounds
   ```

### Quantum Security

- **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**: Support for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- **Secure Quantum Channels**: Built-in quantum key distribution protocols
- **Hardware Security**: Integration with secure quantum hardware backends

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Public Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Day 1-3**: Triage and initial response
3. **Day 7**: Detailed assessment complete
4. **Day 30**: Patch developed and tested
5. **Day 35**: Security advisory published
6. **Day 90**: Full technical details disclosed (if appropriate)

### Credit and Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve Synapse Language:

- **Hall of Fame**: Public recognition for responsible disclosure
- **CVE Credit**: Proper attribution in CVE entries
- **Swag and Rewards**: Synapse merchandise for significant findings
