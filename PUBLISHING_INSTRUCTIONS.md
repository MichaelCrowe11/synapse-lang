## üîê Required: PyPI Account Setup

Before publishing, you need to:

1. **Create PyPI Account** (if not already done):
   - Go to https://pypi.org/account/register/
   - Verify your email

2. **Create Test PyPI Account** (recommended for testing):
   - Go to https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
   - Verify your email

3. **Generate API Tokens**:
   
   For Production PyPI:
   - Login to https://pypi.org
   - Go to Account Settings ‚Üí API tokens
   - Create token with scope "Entire account" or specific to "synapse-lang"
   - Save token (starts with `pypi-`)
   
   For Test PyPI:
   - Login to https://test.pypi.org
   - Go to Account Settings ‚Üí API tokens
   - Create token
   - Save token (starts with `pypi-`)

4. **Configure Credentials**:
   
   Option A: Update `.pypirc` file (created at `C:\Users\micha\synapse-lang\.pypirc`):
   ```ini
   [pypi]
   username = __token__
   password = pypi-YOUR-ACTUAL-TOKEN-HERE
   
   [testpypi]
   username = __token__
   password = pypi-YOUR-TEST-TOKEN-HERE
   ```
   
   Option B: Use environment variables:
   ```bash
   set TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
   set TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
   ```

## üöÄ Publishing Steps

### Step 1: Test PyPI (Recommended First)
```bash
# With configured .pypirc:
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Or with inline credentials:
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* -u __token__ -p pypi-YOUR-TEST-TOKEN
```

After upload, test installation:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ synapse-lang
```

### Step 2: Production PyPI
```bash
# With configured .pypirc:
python -m twine upload dist/*

# Or with inline credentials:
python -m twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p pypi-YOUR-PRODUCTION-TOKEN
```

## üí∞ Post-Publication: Monetization Setup

### 1. Payment Processing
Set up payment gateway at https://synapse-lang.com:
- Stripe/PayPal integration for license purchases
- Automated license key delivery
- Subscription management for renewals

### 2. License Server
Deploy license validation server:
- API endpoint for online license verification
- Machine binding for node-locked licenses
- Usage telemetry collection

### 3. Customer Portal
Create customer self-service portal:
- License key management
- Download previous versions
- Support ticket system

### 4. Marketing Launch
- Announce on social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- Submit to:
  - Python Weekly newsletter
  - Hacker News
  - /r/Python, /r/programming
  - Product Hunt
- Write blog post/tutorial
- Create YouTube demo video

## üìä Expected Metrics

Based on similar scientific computing packages:

| Timeframe | Downloads | Conversions | Revenue |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Week 1 | 100-500 | 1-5 trials | $0 |
| Month 1 | 1,000-5,000 | 10-20 sales | $5-10K |
| Month 3 | 5,000-20,000 | 50-100 sales | $25-50K |
| Year 1 | 50,000+ | 500+ sales | $250K+ |

## üéØ Quick Publish Command

Once credentials are configured, simply run:

```bash
# Windows
cd C:\Users\micha\synapse-lang
publish_production.bat

# Answer prompts:
# - "y" to test on Test PyPI first
# - "y" to continue to production
# - Type "PUBLISH" to confirm
```

## üìù License Key Generation

Generate customer license keys:
```bash
python generate_license.py --type professional --email customer@example.com --format-email
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Package Name**: "synapse-lang" must be unique on PyPI. If taken, consider:
   - synapse-language
   - synapse-sci
   - synapselang

2. **Version Management**: Once published, you cannot overwrite a version. Increment version for updates.

3. **Legal Protection**: The proprietary license is now in effect. Monitor for unauthorized use.

4. **Support Readiness**: Expect support requests immediately after publication.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If upload fails:
- Check network connectivity
- Verify token is correct (starts with `pypi-`)
- Ensure package name is available
- Try Test PyPI first
