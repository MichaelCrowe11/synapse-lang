## 🔧 Features

### Core Language Features
- ✨ Parallel execution with `parallel` blocks
- 📊 Uncertainty quantification with automatic error propagation
- 🧠 Scientific reasoning chains
- ⚛️ Quantum computing support (Enterprise)
- 🚀 GPU acceleration (Professional/Enterprise)
- ⚡ JIT compilation for performance

### Code Example

```python
# Parallel execution with uncertainty
uncertain measurement = 10.0 ± 0.1
uncertain velocity = 25.0 ± 0.5

parallel {
    branch physics: {
        momentum = measurement * velocity
        energy = 0.5 * measurement * velocity^2
    }
    branch statistics: {
        mean = average([measurement, velocity])
        std = std_dev([measurement, velocity])
    }
}

# Results automatically include uncertainty propagation
print(f"Momentum: {momentum}")  # Shows value ± uncertainty
```
